# the webhookinator

<sub>it fuckin sucks</sub>
## this lets you send messages (and maybe an embed) through a webhook url.<br>there are way better websites out there for this so idk why you'd use this one.
<br>

but spin, how do i use it blah blah blah?
- if you cant figure out how to use this, then im sorry for you lol
<br>

## i kinda suck at css and javascript can kiss my ass, so expect things to be broken until i fix them /shrug
